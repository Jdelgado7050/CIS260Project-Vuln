# CIS260 Project - Vulnerability Scanner
This project will include an Vulnerability scanner in which can scan networks for vulnerable devices and list the CVEs listed with them.
When running this project, you will need to install modules needed such as nmap and requests.
I will be building functionalities on top throughout this project and after.

Nice job on starting the documentation, please let me know if you needed anything else on my end - Md
