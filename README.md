# CIS260 Project - Vulnerability Scanner
This project is a Vulnerability Scanner that scans a target host for open ports, detects running services, and queries the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API for known CVE vulnerabilities associated with detected services.
When running this project, you will need to install modules such as nmap and requests.
I will be building functionalities on top throughout this project and after.

Features:
Port Scanning – Uses nmap to detect open ports & running services.

Cross-Platform – Works on Windows, Linux, macOS.

Vulnerability Lookup – Queries the NVD API for known CVEs.


Nice job on starting the documentation, please let me know if you needed anything else on my end - Md
